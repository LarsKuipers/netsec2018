We see a lot of TCP traffic between 192.168.84.21 and 192.168.84.61, as well as between 192.168.84.41 and 192.168.84.61. The traffic looks like random data, and is probably just there to make sure enough data is flowing through the network for us to attack it.

Then we also see a lot of UDP conversations between various hosts, all with the same message. These hosts range from 192.168.84.61-80 as source, and range from 192.168.84.21-60 as destination. Since we have to ARP spoof, which can only be done by one group at a time, these connections are likely all running in parallel on the same machine(s) so that each group can pick one connection to work on. These conversations are obviously interesting when you look at the context, as it contains instructions in readable text for exercise 4.
