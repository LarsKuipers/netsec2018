Rule 9 allows traffic in the 145.116.128.0/22 subnet to be reached directly via 145.116.128.31 (wlp3s0).

Rules 4-6 specify that traffic to local/private/non-routed subnets should go over the wlp3s0 interface, via gateway 145.116.128.1. These rules prevent traffic intended for local/private networks from being routed through the vpn, as that wouldn't make sense (10.0.0.0/8 on the vpn side is not the same as our local 10.0.0.0/8, as these ranges aren't externally routed).
